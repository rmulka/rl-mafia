This application allows Rocket League players to play a fan favorite private match creation - Mafia.

RL Mafia is helpful because when playing private match online, there is no way to get anonymous assignments
for the players in your lobby.

RL Mafia users can sign in under any name and join their friend's lobby or create a new lobby.

Each player will anonymously be assigned to the mafia or the citizens when the lobby host starts the game.

The lobby host can stop and restart the game to get new assignments and adjust the number of players randomly assigned
to the mafia.
